<!--- Thanks https://github.com/Heus-Sueh -->

+ Go to desktop mode, right click the download button above and save the .desktop file to your Steam Deck desktop. 
+ Go to your desktop, click the NonSteamLaunchers icon, it will download and run the latest NonSteamLaunchers.sh from this repository and run it.
+ You will simply have to choose which launcher to install and let the script handle the rest. 💻 No files are left in your "Downloads" they are deleted after installation.
+ After running the script, launch Steam on your Steam Deck. You'll find the new launchers in your library under the non-steam tab. Click a launcher to see your installed games from that store, and launch them directly from Steam! Even in gamemode 🥳
